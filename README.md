# ETS-TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM

Project Description

The ETS Train Ticket Booking System is a terminal-based application developed using C++ that simulates the process of reserving train tickets for the Electric Train Service (ETS). The system allows users to view available train schedules, select routes, book tickets, and automatically calculate the total fare while updating seat availability.

This project is designed to apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, flow control, arrays, structures, functions, and file input/output in a real-world context. Train information is stored in an external data file, enabling the system to be generic and reusable for different train schedules and capacities.

The system is built using a modular design with multiple source files to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability. It provides a simple and user-friendly text-based interface, making it suitable for demonstrating programming and system design principles in an engineering application.
