Purpose of the Program:

The purpose of this program is to develop a terminal-based ETS Train Ticket Booking System using C++. This system enables users to view train schedules, check ticket prices and seat availability, and book tickets for selected routes. It also automatically calculates the total fare and updates the remaining seats in the data file after each booking.

This program is designed to apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, structures, arrays, and file input/output in a practical railway ticket booking scenario.


HOW TO RUN THE CODE??

    *Open a new terminal and type ./ets
